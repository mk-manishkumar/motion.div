# motion.div

It is a collection of small, focused examples built with **`Framer Motion/motion.div`** to explore animations and transitions in React. Each `chapter` demonstrates a specific effect (like button interactions, hover states, and exit animations) to help developers learn and apply smooth, production-ready `UI` animations in their projects.
